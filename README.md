A minimal and secure [Alpine Linux][alpine] based [Docker][docker] image with
[FlexGet][flexget] and [transmissionrpc][rpcplugin] plugin.

## Security

### init

[Tini][tini] is used by the container as an `init` process. It protects the system
from process table being filled up, which can prevent the system from spawning any
new processes, by reaping zombie processes.

In addtion to reaping zombies Tini also performs signal forwarding.

### Firewall

Container uses iptables to configure packet filtering rules in the Linux kernel
and therefore `CAP_NET_ADMIN` capability is required to run the container.

Only local and outbound IPv4 network traffic is allowed.

All IPv6 traffic is blocked.

## Configuration

To learn how to get started with FlexGet see the official [documention][flexget-conf].

### Host user mapping

Host user and group can be mapped to a container by defining `HOST_UID` and
`HOST_GID` environment variables. If the variables are left undefined the
container will execute its command with a random UID/GID combination.

## Logging

Container is compatible with `docker logs` command although logging is disabled
by default if the container is started with `docker-compose` command. To find
out more about logging see the command [reference][docker-logs].

### Debug log

To print out a trace of commands executed by `container-entrypoint` script,
set `DEBUG` environment variable to any non-null value.
